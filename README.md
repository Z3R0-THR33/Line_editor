# Line_editor
This is a mini-project as part of the Foundations of Data Structures and Algorithms Course.
This project uses linked lists, where each line is stored in a Node of the linked list.
One line is stored in a separate node, with advanced features like inserting text into any line n, deleting 
a line n, moving line n to m, replace text in line n, printing all lines, opening and saving on a text file.
